# Natural Language Processing with LLMs

*The code in this repo is [based on scripts](https://github.com/shaankhosla/NLP_with_LLMs) created by my friend and colleague, [Shaan Khosla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaan-khosla/). (Check out his awesome weekly NLP newsletter [Let's Talk Text](https://shaankhosla.substack.com/).)*

I organized this repo to accompany my half-day training on **Natural Language Processing with GPT-4 and other Large Language Models: From Training to Deployment with Hugging Face and PyTorch Lightning**, which will first be offered at the Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) East in Boston on May 10th.

Code can be found in the aptly named [`code`](https://github.com/jonkrohn/NLP-with-LLMs/tree/main/code) directory:
* Jupyter Notebooks are directly supported for execution in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* `.py` files are directly supported for execution via [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/) Core

**The code is intended to be accompanied by live instructions and will not necessarily be self-explanatory.**
