# Natural Language Processing with LLMs

*The code in this repo is [based on scripts](https://github.com/shaankhosla/NLP_with_LLMs) created by my friend and colleague, [Shaan Khosla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaan-khosla/). (Check out his awesome weekly NLP newsletter [Let's Talk Text](https://shaankhosla.substack.com/).)*

### Purpose

I ([Jon Krohn](https://www.jonkrohn.com/)) organized this repo to accompany my half-day training on **Natural Language Processing with GPT-4 and other Large Language Models: From Training to Deployment with Hugging Face and PyTorch Lightning**, which was first offered at the [Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) East](https://odsc.com/boston/) in Boston on May 10th, 2023.

### Code

Code can be found in the aptly named [`code`](https://github.com/jonkrohn/NLP-with-LLMs/tree/main/code) directory:
* Jupyter Notebooks are directly supported for execution in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* `.py` files are for running at the command line, e.g., via [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/) Core

**The code is intended to be accompanied by live instructions and will not necessarily be self-explanatory.**

### Repo Art

The "repo art" was generated by prompting Midjourney v5 with this artistic take on LLMs (that was output by GPT-4):

*Painting of a harmonious blend of [alpacas](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) and [vicu√±as](https://vicuna.lmsys.org/) in rich shades of caramel and soft gray, amidst a lush, futuristic landscape. The animals are surrounded by a web of glowing, pulsating neural network connections in hues of electric blue and neon green, symbolizing the cutting-edge and cost-effective AI training techniques. In the background, a dynamic matrix of binary code cascades down, further emphasizing the technological prowess of the scene.*
