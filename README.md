# Natural Language Processing with LLMs

*The code in this repo is [based on scripts](https://github.com/shaankhosla/NLP_with_LLMs) created by my friend and colleague, [Shaan Khosla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaan-khosla/). (Check out his awesome weekly NLP newsletter [Let's Talk Text](https://shaankhosla.substack.com/).)*

I organized this repo to accompany my half-day training on **Natural Language Processing with GPT-4 and other Large Language Modelss: From Training to Deployment with Hugging Face and PyTorch Lightning**, which will first be offered at the Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) East in Boston on May 10th.
