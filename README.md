# Natural Language Processing with Large Language Models

### Purpose

[Jon Krohn](https://www.jonkrohn.com/) created this repo to accompany his half-day training on **NLP with GPT-4 and other LLMs: From Training to Deployment with Hugging Face and PyTorch Lightning**, which was first offered at the [Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) East](https://odsc.com/boston/) in Boston on May 10th, 2023.

### Code

Code can be found in the aptly named [`code`](https://github.com/jonkrohn/NLP-with-LLMs/tree/main/code) directory:
* Jupyter Notebooks are directly supported for execution in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* `.py` files are for running at the command line (see [instructions](https://github.com/jonkrohn/NLP-with-LLMs/tree/main/instructions))

N.B.: Code is intended to be accompanied by live instructions and so it will not necessarily be self-explanatory.

### Repo Art

The "repo art" above was generated by prompting Midjourney v5 with this artistic take on LLMs (that was output by GPT-4):

*Painting of a harmonious blend of [alpacas](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) and [vicu√±as](https://vicuna.lmsys.org/) in rich shades of caramel and soft gray, amidst a lush, futuristic landscape. The animals are surrounded by a web of glowing, pulsating neural network connections in hues of electric blue and neon green, symbolizing the cutting-edge and cost-effective AI training techniques. In the background, a dynamic matrix of binary code cascades down, further emphasizing the technological prowess of the scene.*
